# Certified Associate in Python Programming Certification

## Repository description:
This is a repository where I keep the code I'm working through in Keith Thompson's Linux Academy course: [https://linuxacademy.com/course/certified-associate-in-python-programming-certification/][1]

## Course description from Linux Academy website:
The Certified Associate in Python Programming Certification (PCAP) is a great place to start when getting Python certified. The Python Institute provides multiple certification exams for Python ranging from entry-level to professional-level. This course is designed to teach the fundamentals of Python required to take and pass the Certified Associate in Python Programming Certification exam before moving onto more advanced certifications.

Note: A prerequisite to this course is understanding all the content covered in the Certified Entry-Level Python Programmer Certification course.

Throughout this course we cover:

Lambdas Higher-order functions Modules Packages Classes and objects Exceptions Assertions File IO

## Repository notes:
- I may not include all hands-on modules and some of the ones I have included in the repository may not contain necessary data such as pre-populated sqlite database files, etc.
- Sometimes I modify the examples from the course, but usually my modifications are just additional comments, docstrings and doctests.
